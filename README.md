## Scratch Addons
I've also contributed to Scratch Addons which is a browser extension, the goal of which is to combine all existing Scratch extensions, userscripts and userstyles into a single easy-to-access place. I've worked on the addons settings page and submitted my own addons. <a href="https://github.com/ScratchAddons/ScratchAddons">Check it out!</a>
